# 3-D Temperature Control

This repository contains code for the 3-D temperature control of a cube. This is a linear model predicitve control (MPC) problem constructed in `DynamicNLPModels.jl` and solved with `Ipopt` and `MadNLP.jl`. The results are presented in the conference proceedings, "Interior Point Methods on GPU/SIMD Architecture for Linear MPC".

This repository will be updated in the near future.
